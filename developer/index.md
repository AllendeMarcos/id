# Developer documentation

This is the developer documentation for everisID. Here, you will find all the resources you need to make your app or website work with everisID.

EverisID is a trust framework, i.e. a certain way to use standard protocols in order to allow people and organizations to authenticate to each other.

Just like all the protocols and communication frameworks that comprise the Internet, no single entity owns everisID. This means that you're free to follow or not the protocols and methods proposed in this documentation. It also means that none of what is described here depends on a specific service, unlike proprietary identity/authentication platforms.
